# Sign Language Recognition
Training a CNN to identify Sign Language Gestures. Performing gesture recognition using live video feed through the laptop web-camera.

### Resources:
1. [Images Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ahmedkhanak1995/sign-language-gesture-images-dataset)
2. [Document - Hand Recognition and Gesture Control Using a Laptop Web-camera](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs231a/prev_projects_2016/CS231A_Project_Final.pdf)

### Contents:
1. neural-network-training-and-evaluation.ipynb - trains the CNN on the images dataset from Kaggle.
2. video-feed.ipynb - performs the recognition using video feed through laptop web-camera.
3. gesture-images.jpg - shows the hand gestures for different alphabets and numbers.
4. gesture-images-preprocessed.jpg - shows how the images look after backgroung subtraction.
5. sign-language-recognition.h5 - contains the trained CNN.
6. mapping.json - maps the characters with their respective numbers.

### Results:
Got correct prediction 9 out of 10 times when performing recognition using video feed.
